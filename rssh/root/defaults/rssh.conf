#user=rudy:077:000100   # the ending colon is optional

#user=rudy:011:001000:  # cvs, with no chroot
#user=rudy:011:010000:  # rdist, with no chroot
#user=rudy:011:100000:  # rsync, with no chroot
#user=rudy:011:000001:  # svnserve, with no chroot
#user="rudy:011:000010:/usr/local/chroot"  # whole user string can be quoted
#user=rudy:01"1:000010:/usr/local/chroot"  # or somewhere in the middle, freak!
#user=rudy:'011:000010:/usr/local/chroot'  # single quotes too

# if your chroot_path contains spaces, it must be quoted...
# In the following examples, the chroot_path is "/usr/local/my chroot"
#user=rudy:011:000010:"/usr/local/my chroot"  # scp with chroot
#user=rudy:011:000100:"/usr/local/my chroot"  # sftp with chroot
#user=rudy:011:000110:"/usr/local/my chroot"  # both with chroot

# Spaces before or after the '=' are fine, but spaces in chrootpath need
# quotes.
#user = "rudy:011:000010:/usr/local/my chroot"
#user = "rudy:011:000010:/usr/local/my chroot"  # neither do comments at line end
